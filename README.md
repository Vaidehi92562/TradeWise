# TradeWise - A Smart Mock Trading Platform Simulation

## Project Overview
TradeWise is a smart mock trading platform simulation developed as part of the course **21IPE333P – Essentials in Cloud and DevOps**.  
The platform allows users to explore stock trading concepts in a safe, risk-free environment using virtual money. It is designed to simulate core trading workflows such as user login, stock browsing, buy/sell actions, watchlist management, portfolio tracking, and transaction monitoring.

Along with the software engineering aspects of the application, the project also demonstrates important **Cloud and DevOps practices** including containerization, service orchestration, continuous integration, monitoring, observability, and Kubernetes-based deployment setup.

---

## Objective
The main objective of TradeWise is to provide a simple and interactive stock trading simulation platform where users can practice trading logic without using real money, while also showcasing practical implementation of DevOps tools and workflows.
